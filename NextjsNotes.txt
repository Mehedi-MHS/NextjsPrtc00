<Image> component.
========================
1. No need to use react Suspense or react Lazy method for image in nextjs. Use these for loading other components. 
2. Use placeholder="blur" and at the same time blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg....." like base64 image as a placeholder that will be shown during the image load.
3. loading="lazy" for lazy loading image automatically.
4. There are also some useful functions like 
   quality={value from 0-100}
  onLoadingComplete	onLoadingComplete={img => done())}	Function	-
  onLoad	onLoad={event => done())}	Function	-
  onError	onError(event => fail()}	Function	-

 

 Error Handling .
 ===================
 1. Create error.js file like loader.js that will be used for showing custom error page.
 2. If you want to add an error page in the root directory to handle all the error globally, then you have to add global-error.js instead of error.js file.
